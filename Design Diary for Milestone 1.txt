 One difficulty I had while completing this milestone was one that was resolved during the lab hours today.
I wasn't able to change the size of my canvas to match the size of the instructor's in the tutorial. This resulted
in me having to use different sizes for my cards and my PlayerAreas/dropzone. It wasn't much of an issue in terms of
how the game ran, but I did struggle to find a solution online. I was able to increase the size of the canvas once
a solution was given in lab. I didn't really have a problem that I was unable to resolve, given that it was a tutorial
that guided me every step of the way. I'm sure I will struggle much more on the next milestone.
 It was cool learning how certain things affected a component. For example, how a Rigidbody component puts the object it
 is added to under the control of the Unity Physics engine.
